-> Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that transforms high-dimensions data into lower-dimensions 
while retaining as much information as possible.
-> One important thing to note about PCA is that it is an Unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, 
you can cluster the similar data points based on the feature correlation between them without any supervision (or labels)
